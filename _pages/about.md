Hello ðŸ‘‹! 

I am a Data Scientist in Professor Sophia Wangâ€™s research group, [Ophthalmic Informatics and Artificial Intelligence Group](https://optima.sites.stanford.edu), at the Stanford School of Medicine. The group broadly focuses on using a variety of data modalities (i.e., EHR, clinical notes, imaging) to build predictive models for glaucoma. Currently, my work focuses on building predictive models for glaucoma surgery progression using a multi-center datacenter, [SOURCE](https://www.sourcecollaborative.org/). Some challenges I attempt to solve are data irregularity, sparsity, heterogeneity, and model opacity. 

Previously at Columbia University as a graduate student, I worked closely with Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi in her lab [PRAISE](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ansaf/praise/index.html). My work there focused on building predictive models for spinal surgery outcomes. My theoretical work was heavily based on knowledge distillation and privileged information due to the rarity of the surgery and, thus, data. I proposed a variant of XGBoost, XGBoost+, that uses privileged information (data available during training but not at inference), to increase the modelâ€™s predictive power. I show empirically that this model performs better than its parent, XGBoost, and other tree-based models.

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. I am interested in solving challenges such as representation learning, explainability, and multi-model learning. These are key challenges that must be solved before bringing our research to a clinical setting.
