excerpt: 'Prior artificial intelligence (AI) models for predicting glaucoma progression have used a traditional classification approach that does not consider the longitudinal nature of patients' follow-up. In the present study, we developed survival-based AI models for predicting glaucoma patients’ progression to surgery, comparing performance among regression-, tree-, and deep-learning-based approaches.'
