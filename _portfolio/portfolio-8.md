With all the news outlet talking about coronavirus, it gets hard (personally) to decide which outlet is truthful or just manipulating the data. This dashboard was created with the idea to create an objective view of the coronavirus with real-time time data updated daily from proper officals.

This dashboard focuses mainly on California and then World since in the begining I was for personal, but later on it could be expanded.

## Data Preparation
The most important part of this project was the data source. The data used for this project comes to validated and the proper sources.

The California data is from the publicly avaiable dataset hosted by the [California Gov't](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-cases).

The World data is aquired from the Our World In Data which relies on the [Europen CDC](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data):
